This project demonstrates how to perform end-to-end testing with `Tauri v2` using `Selenium`.<br>
For documentation of how to use the `Selenium` package see

# Note: 
This project was primarily created as an experiment to learn JavaScript/TypeScript package management and release processes. While it may not represent the best or most sustainable approach for testing in the future, it can still serve as a useful example or starting point for similar projects.

# Note2:
I had to disable gh actions for this project due to huge amount of $$ credits being used for running them.
